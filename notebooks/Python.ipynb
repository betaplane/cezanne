    "# Practicalities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conda\n",
    "\n",
    "[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is a combined package and environment manager with a focus on Python (but not exclusively so anymore). \"Environments\" have been part of the Python microcosmos for some time and in various incarnations; the idea is to \"isolate\" as much as possible one particular installation of Python, including an interpreter and any possibly installed third-party extensions. An environment consists of a folder inside of which the typical Linux file system structure is replicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Environments need to be\n",
    "- created (once)\n",
    "- activated (every time you want to use them)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for using these \"quarantined zones\" is that it is quite common to have several different versions of Python interpreters (we will talk about what that is shortly) installed on your system, with various levels of restrictions. Most operating systems these days come with a Python interpreter pre-instaled, so that in principle you could just use that one. However, in some cases (e.g. MacOS), the built-in Python is a special version with OS-specific capabilities (on the Mac, you could use Python together with the built-in version to write full-fledged MacOS GUI applications), but also limitations, e.g. on where you can install third-party libraries. On MacOS, the relatively new \"System Integrity Protection (SIP)\" means you can't install libraries in the places Python would like to install them, resulting in all kind of workarounds becoming necessary. Also, you might sometimes want a really brand-new version of Python, which is also not likely to be the one that comes with your OS.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should maybe be pointed out that if you're using a Conda environmnet (i.e. a folder, typically in a specific place within the file system tree in which Conda itself resides), that does not mean everything you work on has to happen inside that folder - far from it. Personally, I leave these environment folders completely untouched and put my code in some other place.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you **activate** and environment, this simply means that a few file system paths are placed before any others onto the search path, both for the general shell environment and Python itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that background, here a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create -n <name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Activate an environmnet:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda activate <name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Install a third-party module\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install [-c <channel>] <name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if an environment is activated, the install command will install **into the activate environment.** Otherwise, you can give it a `-n` switch to tell it into which environment to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter / IPython\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) set of tools consists of several \"frontends\" to work interactively with Python, of which I will briefly mentione 2: the [console](https://jupyter-console.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and the [notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Console\n",
    "\n",
    "The console (`jupyter console`) and [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are identical in that the Jupyter console internally uses IPython as the outward-facing frontend. IPython stands for \"interactive Python\" and is a REPL shell similar to the one built into the Python interpreter, but with enhanced capabilities (better tab completions, history, post-mortem debugger and many others). The difference between evoking `ipython` and `jupyter console` on the command line is that Jupyter separates the frontend from the Python \"kernel\", allowing several frontends (e.g. both a console and a notebook) to connected to the same kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "... is what we're using right now, and hopefully you will get a sense of how they work as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A trick for all of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "One particularly useful trick for IPython / Jupyter is the following: use `_` (single underscore) to refer to the result from the previous line, and `__` (double underscore) for the one before that (I believe in Matlab you could use `ans` or something along those lines). In fact, all results are kept in the list `Out` and can be referenced again later by index (e.g. `Out[243]`) as indicated at the beginning of each line of output (see below)."

    "- dynamically typed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compilers vs. Interpreters\n",
    "\n",
    "A **compiler** is a program that takes source code as input and produces an **executable** file which can be loaded and run directly by a computer's operating system. The compiler is typically specific to a particular computing platform and produces (in general) only executables for that particular platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **interpreter** is a program that takes a text file which contains programmatic statements and exectues them immediately. The interpreter, like the compiler, is specific to a particular platform. \n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the code is (more or less) independent of the platform, but in the case of an interpreted language, it can be executed immediately on any platform, as long as a corresponding interpreter is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program you usually call be executing `python` on the command line is the Python interpreter. Like with some, but by no means all, other scripting languages, the Python interpreter doubles as a **\"shell\"**. That is, there are two fundamental modes of working with Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. run a script: `python script.py`\n",
    "2. work interactively (**'REPL'**): `python`\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms 'interpreted language' and 'scripting language' are synonymous (I think). 'Shells' such as *bash* work essentially in the same way as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on running scripts in general (which you'll probably never do...)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, script files of all kinds can be executed on \\*nix architectures by setting the right permissions (`chmod 755 script.py`) and calling them with the `./` prefix. For the operating system to know which interpreter to invoke, you can give the script a **\"shebang\"** line at the very top:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is not needed if you call the script excplicitely with the Python interpreter:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "The shebang line can be useful if you want to make sure the script gets executed by a specific Python interpreter, e.g. one associated with a specific *conda* environment:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#!/path/to/a/specific/python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(The line `#!/usr/bin/env python` actually asks the current shell environement for the location of the Python interpreter and will substitute the correct one if a particular conda environment is activated.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a variable?\n",
    "### in mathematics:\n",
    "- a symbol which we imagine to be able to take on an arbitrary value\n",
    "    - sometimes, it stands for *all* the values it can take on\n",
    "    - sometimes, it stands for *a particular* value which we don't know explicitely\n",
    "\n",
    "### in programming:\n",
    "- a memory location that holds a given value at a given time\n",
    "- that can be overwritten with a different value at any time\n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming languages require you to **declare** variables before you can use them. That means in particular:\n",
    "- declare the variable to be of a certain **type**\n",
    "- declare the variable **\"shape\"** (in the case of **arrays**)\n",
    "- in the case of static memory allocation, also the **size**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not require you to declare variables; instead, it **infers** a lot of what it needs to know:"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can assign variables at any given place in a script or module, unlike in some compiled languages which require you to declare all variables at the beginning of a program. The reason why compiled languages often require you to declare variables at the beginning of the program is because the operating system needs to know how much memory the program requires to run. Any variable defined in the program takes up a memory location. \n",

    "## Memory allocation and garbage collection\n",
    "\n",
    "A program can also request memory from the operating system while it is already running: this is called **dynamic memory allocation** and is pretty much how most programs operate nowadays. In fact, under the hood, Python needs to request memory from the operating system every time you type something like `a = 5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, dynamically allocated memory also needs to be freed again at some point, lest a program keep eating up more and more of the computer's available RAM (if that happens, it is called a *memory leak*). While many compiled programming languages require you to do the work of deallocating memory again yourself, Python uses **garbage collection** - it deallocates memory automatically if it determines it is no longer needed (how it does that is certainly beyond an introduction and need not concern you). \n",
    "\n",
    "(As a side note: statically declared variables do not need to be deallocated even in compiled languages; dynamic allocation is usually exclusively used for **arrays** of variables, a concept we will get to later.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Automatic typecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen above that Python has a concept called **\"type\"** - e.g. a number can be a `float` or an `int`, and there are other basice types such as strings (`str`). Any memory location holds only a sequence of `0`s and `1`s, and in order for such sequences to \"mean\" anything, knowledge of what is represented is necessary; such knowledge is represented by the informations **\"type\"**. The same binary sequence in computer memory may represent different numbers depending on whether its associated type is \"integer\" or \"floating point\", and re-interpreted as a character, it will most obviously correspond to something completely different.\n",

It doesn't describe a language per se and can be implemented in principle in any langauge, but many languages are built around this paradigm and provide corresponding elements and structures.

In case you ever look at other people's code and get confused, I will mention here that in Python 2, there used to be \"old style\" and \"new style\" classes which differed in the way they were declared: `class Eagle():` for old style and `class Eagle(object):` for new style. Python 3 only has new style classes and it doesn't matter if you declare them with or without the `(object)` - however, the syntax with the parentheses **does** have a meaning and we will learn about that shortly.\n",

A basic motivation behind OOP is that code created by one programmer can be used by another one without knowing any of the details: The \"object\" encapsulates the (hopefully documented) functionality, and whoever uses your object only needs to know **what** the method accomplishes, not **how**. For that reason, many languages include a provision for instance variables on objects that are not visible from the \"outside\" and only used in the internal workings of the object.\n",

The only difference lies in how we talk about them syntactically: I write `a = 1` or `name = \"Arno\"` instead of instantiating an object and giving some instance variable of it a value - but that's what Python is doing under the hood.\n",

When you write a Python script or work interactively as we are doing here right now, there is a certain number of fundamental statements that the interpreter will understand - all of the ones we have used so far belong to this category. You will have noticed that those \"always present\" language elements comprise both *statements* (like the `try: except:` statement we just talked about) and functions (like the `print()` function).\n",

    "Additional libraries in Python are called **modules**. A module is always *one* text file containing the code that provides the additional functionality. This may include functions, classes or even just variables. Modules have to be **imported** before the code they provide is available to the interpreter. Once imported, the module is just another \"object\" whose attributes (i.e. everything the module defines) can be accessed by dot-accessor syntax.\n",

    "Here's the thing: **<span style=\"color:red\">This is indeed confusing</span>**, in particular because it is not always clear with third-party libraries such as Numpy what type of behavior they implement. To be fair, Python itself should probably behave like Numpy does - because then we'd know once and for all that everything is an object, everything is a pointer.

    "# Debugging\n",

    "I will restrict talking about specific software to one particular issue: debugging. As you have already seen, Python is quite good with throwing expressive error messages, although it is obviously up to the developer of third-party libraries to implement similarly expressive ones for those.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very, very briefly, debugging entails mainly the inspection of variable values in order to see if any of them are different from what you were expecting. This can be done manyally, by inserting `print` statements into your code to print out the value of variables at a given place in the code, or by means of a **debugger**, which can drop you off at a given location in the code and allows you to inspect any variable's value defined at that particular location. Debuggers also generally allow you to execute code in a stepwise fashion, so you can slowly work yourself towards the location where the error ocurred.\n",
    " \n",
    "Personally, I almost exclusively use the debugging entrypoints that come with IPython / Jupyter (which in turn use Python's own debugger. The really useful feature here is that IPython and Jupyter come with the `%debug` magic which can be invoked **after** an error has been thrown and inserts you right at the place in the code where the error ocurred (so-called *post-mortem* tracing). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running some code interactively from IPython or the Jupyter console and an error occurs, you can simply execute the command `%debug` (IPython and Jupyter define a number of `%`-prefaced commands for various purpuses they call \"magics\" - the other very usefule one being `%matplotlib`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `%debug` command will enter the debugger post-mortem and drop you at the point in the *stack* (sort of the \"inbox\" of the operating system where all directives that are to be executed in the near future are being placed in order) where the error caused the overall program to crash; this may not be the location where the error occurred. You are placed on a command line interface where typing the name of a variable will print out its value, unless this name collides with one of the debugger's commands, in which case you should wrap it into a `print` statement. You can execute any Python code at this point, using the variables that are defined at that location.\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in commands of the debugger include\n",
    "- `u` - go \"up\" in the hierarchy of nested function calls that define the current position in the stack\n",
    "- `n` - go to the \"next\" step in the program\n",
    "- `s` - \"step\" **into** a function (if a function is to be called in the \"next\" step, `n` will simply execute the function and return to the next line **after** the function, whereas `s` will step **inside** the function body)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, you can also direct your code directly to stop at a specific place, by putting the following snipped at the location you want to stop at:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from IPython.core.debugger import set_trace; set_trace()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will execute your code up to this location and then drop into the debugger.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Documenting\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in way to document the code you write (which is pretty much identical to the system Matlab uses), and it's called the **\"docstring\"**. A string placed immediately underneath the heading of a function definition will be displayed if you ask your Python environment of choice for help."
