    "# Relationship between snow-covered area and volume of snow\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical models discribing river discharge have been developed for basins in which most of the precipitation falls as snow, and where snow-covered area (which is easily measured remotely) can hence be substituted as a proxy for direct measurements of precipitation. To obtain a good statistical fit, a power-law relationship is frequently employed <cite data-cite=\"2031184/EX28JTRX\"></cite>:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q_{current} = a A^b + c Q_{near} + d Q_{long}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple argument for why such a power-law fit might arise can be made by considering the relationship between snow volume and snow-covered area. Any given snow event will contribute more to an increase in total snow-covered area if there is very little existing snow-cover; if, on the other hand, the area is completely covered already, a shower will contribute its precipitation volume without affecting the snow-covered area.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say that an increment in area due to an increment in volume is proportional to the probability of an \"infinitesimal\" shower occurring over the snow-free area:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}V} = \\frac{1 - A}{d}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the snow-covered area $A$ is normalized with respect to the total available area, and the constant of proportionality $d$ is depth-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution in terms of $V(A)$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(A) = -d \\ln \\left(1 - A \\right) + C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It therefore appears that precipitation volume (and after snow melt, discharge) should fundamentally be related to snow-covered area via the logarithm of its complement (the snow-free area). The function $- \\ln (1-x)$ has the Taylor Series Expansion $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} x^n/n$ on $[-1,1[$, and a statistical fit to some power is plausible; what numerical value of the exponent performs best presumably depends and the measurements available to perform the fit."
